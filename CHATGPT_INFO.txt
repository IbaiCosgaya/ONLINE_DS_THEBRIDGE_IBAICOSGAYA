Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Groom Artist position at Milk VFX. As a junior Houdini FX Artist with one year of experience in Houdini and NukeX, I believe I have the necessary skills to be a valuable member of your team. In addition to my knowledge of Unreal Engine 5, Arnold, Speedtree, and Photoshop, I have a particular passion for grooming and have recently completed a Scottish Cow groom exercise.

My experience in Houdini has allowed me to develop a strong foundation in procedural workflows, which I believe is a valuable asset when it comes to grooming. I understand the importance of being able to create realistic and believable animal fur, hair, and feathers, and I have spent a considerable amount of time researching and experimenting with different grooming techniques. My Scottish Cow groom exercise is a testament to my dedication to the craft, and I am confident that I can apply this knowledge to any project that comes my way.

I am excited about the opportunity to work with a team of talented artists at Milk VFX and contribute to the creation of stunning visual effects. I am a quick learner, a team player, and am always eager to learn new skills and techniques. I believe that my passion for grooming, combined with my technical skills and willingness to learn, make me an ideal candidate for this position.

Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Sincerely,

Ibai Cosgaya Prieto
